Project Description 
------------------- 
 
The aim of this project is to design and build a two-wheeled self balancing pick and placer robot.
 The basic two wheeled self balancing robot works on the principle of inverted pendulum device 
 which utilizes forward and backward pitch/tilting angle as a control factor. 
 The implementation utilizes both an accelerometer and a rate-gyroscope data ,
 wheel motor encoder output with PID algorithm for wheel motor direction and speed control
 in order to achieve a vertical balance. The fusion of both sensor data into a combined angle
 value was achieved through a complementary filter. Two servo motors are used to control the arm and grip movement. 
 This project attempted to develop a two-wheeled robot with an arm attached for picking and placing the objects.
